# Odi_cricket_analysis-Bangladesh-
This is a data analysis project featuring bangladesh cricket team analysis between year 2002 to 2023.
As a passionate cricket enthusiast and data aficionado, I've embarked on an exciting journey to analyze and visualize ODI cricket match data, with a particular focus on the performance of the Bangladesh national cricket team.
I've been working diligently with Python and Pandas, diving into the extensive world of ODI cricket data to unveil patterns, statistics, and insights that provide a fresh perspective on Bangladesh's ODI journey.
Datasets were taken from kaggle.
